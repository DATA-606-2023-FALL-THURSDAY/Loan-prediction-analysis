## Background 


* A chronic disease is a long-lasting medical condition that can be controlled but not cured. chronic diseases are non-communicable meaning they are not infectious and cannot be transmitted from one person to another.

* Chronic diseases are a major public health concern in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),  chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, and diabetes are the leading causes of death and disability in the US. 

* U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators (CDI) is a database maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that provides access to state-level data on 20 over chronic disease indicators.


* The United States Chronic Disease Indicator is a crucial tool in the effort to monitor, manage, and combat chronic diseases in the United States. By standardizing the collection and exchange of health data related to chronic conditions, it plays a vital role in improving healthcare quality, patient outcomes, and public health strategies.




## Research questions

* Trends in Chronic Disease Prevalence: What are the trends in the prevalence of chronic diseases over the years covered by the dataset? Are certain chronic diseases becoming more or less common?

* Geographical Variations: Are there significant geographical variations in the prevalence of specific chronic diseases or health outcomes? Do certain regions have higher or lower rates of chronic conditions?

* Temporal Changes: Have there been significant changes in the rates of chronic diseases over the years in different locations? Are there any notable patterns or fluctuations?

* Health Disparities: Do health disparities exist among different demographic groups (stratification categories)? For example, do certain age groups, genders, or racial/ethnic groups have higher rates of chronic diseases?

* Mortality Trends: Are there trends in mortality rates related to specific chronic diseases? Have mortality rates improved or worsened over time?


## Data

* Data Source : Source:https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/g4ie-h725/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD

* Description:  The CDC's Division of Population Health has created a standardized set of 124 indicators that states, territories, and large metropolitan areas can use to collect and report chronic disease data. These indicators were developed through consensus and are important for public health practice.

* Data Size : 342 MB

* Data Shape : Total number of rows 1185676 , Total number of columns 34
